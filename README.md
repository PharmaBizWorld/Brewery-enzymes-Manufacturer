 The Role of Enzymes in Brewing
Enzymes are vital in the brewing process. They act as catalysts in the breakdown of complex sugars, proteins, and starches found in raw materials such as barley and corn, helping convert these into fermentable sugars that yeast can utilize to produce alcohol. Enzymes also improve the quality and consistency of beer by reducing haze, enhancing flavor profiles, and optimizing brewing time. For brewers, having the right enzyme formulations is essential to maintaining consistency, quality, and productivity.
